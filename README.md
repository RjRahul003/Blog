# Scenario
A pharma company released a new drug that can cure cancer. However, this drug is fatal for patients with a particular set of molecules in their DNA. Let us assume that a single DNA strand is enough to identify if a drug is fatal for a person. Let us also assume that each molecule in the DNA can be one among four types. Problem is, each DNA strand is two billion molecules long, and it is hard to identify problematic molecules manually.
The company is interested in training a classifier to automatically decide if this treatment is safe for the patient. They have collected DNA strands from ten thousand people. The drug is fatal for hundred among these ten thousand people. They have provided both the DNA strand data, and its corresponding label (safe or fatal). For clarity, let’s assume the label “safe” is a positive label and label “fatal” is a negative label.
